-- Trainer Rematch: talk to a trainer you have already beaten to get a
-- rematch.  Rematch battles award a percentage of the usual money and
-- experience (MODS > Trainer Rematch: 0-100% in 10% steps; money
-- defaults to 0%, XP to 100%).  Each trainer class opens with a line in
-- its own voice, matched to the personality that class shows in its
-- regular dialogue.

-- One line per trainer class, written in the class's voice.  The line
-- leads straight into the YES/NO prompt, so every one reads as a
-- challenge.  Rows are the text box's lines (max 18 chars each, max 2 lines per box).

-- ------------------------------------------------- "still owes" this talk
--
-- On Gold/Silver/Crystal a beaten Gym Leader is not finished with the player
-- yet: the battle only sets EVENT_BEAT_<leader>, and the badge (and often a TM)
-- follows from their own talk.  Whitney is the plain case -- she cries, blocks
-- the door, and only hands over PLAINBADGE on the talk after the trip-wire at
-- (8,5) -- while Falkner and the rest of the Johto leaders re-offer their TM to
-- a party that was full, Erika and Janine hand theirs over on a later talk, and
-- Clair's RISINGBADGE comes from the Dragon's Den elder with her TM still to
-- come.  Taking one of those talks for the rematch prompt is what left players
-- unable to get the badge at all (and would quietly cost the TM), so a leader
-- keeps their own conversation until the script has nothing left to give.
--
-- The walk below follows only what it understands: event and engine-flag
-- checks, the branches they select, and the ops that are pure talk.  Anything
-- else -- a setevent, a giveitem, an op that needs the VM -- counts as
-- unfinished business, so a script this mod cannot read keeps its talk rather
