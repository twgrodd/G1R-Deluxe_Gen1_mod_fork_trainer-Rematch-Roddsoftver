# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [0.5.7] - 2026-10-07

### Fixed

- **Gen 2 story-critical trainer dialogue**: defeated trainers whose post-battle
  conversation still performs a progression side effect now keep their vanilla
  dialogue before the rematch prompt can appear.
- **Mahogany Team Rocket passwords**: the Rocket grunts that reveal the
  passwords in the Team Rocket HQ can now complete their password dialogue
  normally after being defeated. Once the relevant story event is set, later
  conversations can offer a rematch as usual.
- Added regression coverage for the password-grunt flow so rematches cannot
  replace the progression dialogue again.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- **Gym Leaders still owe you their badge or TM**: a beaten Gym Leader on
  Gold/Silver/Crystal is not finished when the battle ends. The battle only
  sets `EVENT_BEAT_<leader>`, and their own talk afterwards hands the badge
  over -- Whitney cries and blocks the door until the trip-wire at (8,5)
  clears event 40, so `PLAINBADGE` only comes from the *next* talk, and
  Clair's `RISINGBADGE` comes from the Dragon's Den elder. The rematch prompt
  was taking that talk, which left players with no way to get the badge at all
  (they had to disable the mod, talk to the leader, and re-enable it; with this
  version, talking to the leader again hands it over).
  A Leader who still owes the player their badge now keeps their own
  conversation, and so does one who is only owed their TM -- Falkner, Bugsy,
  Morty, Chuck, Jasmine and Pryce re-offer theirs when the party was full, and
  Erika, Janine and Clair hand theirs over on a later talk. Once the hand-over
  is done the class offers a rematch exactly as before.
- **Badge reading across saves**: the badge is now looked for in the store the
  save actually uses -- `save.player.badges` (Johto), `save.player.kantoBadges`
  (Kanto), by name with the badge's bit position as the fallback, or Gen 1's
  bag item -- instead of only `save.player.badges` by name. The hard-coded
  `ENGINE_*BADGE` numbers are gone: that numbering shifts between Gold and
  Crystal (Crystal's `PLAINBADGE` is 29, not 28), and the engine already keeps
  a badge and its engine flag in one store.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- **Gen 1 Active Game Resolution**: Resolved a crash (`attempt to index local 'activeGame' (a nil value)`) when speaking to defeated trainers in Generation 1 (*Red, Blue, Yellow*) by adding robust fallback resolution to the engine's Game singleton.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- **First-Time Gym Leader Defeat & Badges**: Resolved an issue where early-game story flags caused undefeated Gym Leaders (such as Falkner) to be mistakenly treated as already defeated on first encounter. Talking to undefeated Gym Leaders now plays their proper story intro and awards their official gym badge and TM upon victory.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- **Full Generation 2 Support**: Trainer Rematches now work seamlessly in *Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal* alongside *Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow*.
- **Gym Leader & Boss Rematches**: Talk to beaten Gym Leaders (Falkner, Bugsy, Whitney, Morty, Chuck, Jasmine, Pryce, Clair, and Kanto leaders), Elite Four members, and Champions anytime to challenge them to a rematch.
- **Custom Character Dialogue**: Unique opening challenges, decline reactions, and level-gap warnings tailored to every trainer class and Gym Leader across both generations.
- **Configurable Rewards**: Custom EXP (0–100%) and Prize Money (0–100%) multipliers configurable from the in-game MODS menu.

### Fixed

- **Clean Dialogue Pacing**: Re-paginated all dialogue boxes to adhere to standard screen widths, preventing text from auto-advancing unexpectedly.
- **Gym Leader Interaction**: Resolved an issue where talking to defeated Gym Leaders in Gen 2 would repeat standard advice instead of offering a rematch.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed

- The Rocket Hideout B4F grunt that drops the LIFT KEY keeps his scripted
  drop. On engines older than v0.1.17 his after-battle talk is not a
  hand-ported script, so the rematch prompt replaced the key drop and the
  LIFT KEY never appeared. The manifest now gates those engines out
  (`game_version` requires v0.1.17+; the dev engine still loads), matching
  the engine's own fix (bryanthaboi/gen1recomp #90 / #105).

## [0.4.3] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed

- Rematch XP percentage now applies. The old wrap scaled the participant
  split, which the engine floors back to 1 for the normal single-participant
  rematch — so 0%-90% all paid full EXP. The finished EXP is now scaled
  after the battle, and the flag can't leak into the next battle.
- README and mod.card now state the rematch money default correctly (0%,
  not 25%).

### Changed

- Pure `scaleByPercent` / `resolvePartyIndex` / `resolveParty` helpers
  extracted from the money and party-selection paths and exported for
  tests; the full `battle.exp_award` -> `exp.gain` path is now covered.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-08-02

### Changed

- Rematch money now defaults to 0% (the original no-prize behaviour);
  the percentage sliders are unchanged.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- Rematch earnings are now configurable in MODS > Trainer Rematch:
  - **REMATCH MONEY %** - a percentage of the usual trainer prize money,
    stepped in 10% intervals from 0% to 100% (default 25%).
  - **REMATCH XP %** - a percentage of the usual experience gained,
    stepped in 10% intervals from 0% to 100% (default 100%, unchanged
    behaviour).
- At 0% money the prize line is still suppressed (no "You got ¥0" box);
  Pay Day remains disabled on rematches.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- Strength warning: when the rematch team averages more than 10 levels
  above the player's party, the trainer warns in its own voice ("My team
  is far stronger than yours...") and asks a second time before the battle
  starts.  Declining walks away with the class's usual decline line.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- A trainer record may mark a dedicated rematch team via `rematchIndex`
  (Yellow Legacy Changes 1.6.0+ ships the hack's gym-leader, Elite Four
  and Champion rematch teams this way); the rematch battle then uses that
  team instead of the trainer's own.  Without a marker, behavior is
  unchanged.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- Rematch prompt when talking to a defeated field trainer (YES/NO).
- Per-trainer-class rematch dialogue in the class's own voice.
- Per-trainer-class decline reaction: mocking for cocky classes, understanding for wise ones.
- No money rewards for rematch battles (trainer prize and Pay Day suppressed).
- The trainer's vanilla post-battle dialogue follows the decline reaction.
